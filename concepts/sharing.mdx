# Sharing & Visibility

Roulette provides granular control over who can access company data within your team.

## Visibility Levels

Each company can have one of three visibility settings:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Only visible to the user who created it
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared" icon="user-group">
    Visible to specific users you choose
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team" icon="users">
    Visible to all team members (default)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setting Visibility

When creating a company via the AI upload endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -F "text=Company info here" \
  -F "name=Stealth Startup" \
  -F "visibility=private"
```

Or update an existing company:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/{company_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "visibility": "team"
  }'
```

## Filtering by Visibility

List companies with a specific visibility level:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies?visibility=private" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Company Assignees

Companies can have team members assigned to them. Assignees are returned with the company data:

```json
{
  "id": "company-uuid",
  "name": "Acme Corp",
  "assignees": [
    {
      "id": "user-uuid",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "picture_url": "https://..."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  Visibility settings work in conjunction with your team's roles and permissions.
  Even with "team" visibility, users must have the appropriate permissions to view companies.
