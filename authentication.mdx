## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Getting your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Log into your [Roulette dashboard](https://useroulette.com) and navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Key">
    Click **Create API Key** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production", "Development", "Zapier Integration").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Store Securely">
    Copy the generated API key immediately. For security reasons, you won't be able to see the full key again.

    <Warning>
      Never share your API key or commit it to version control. Use environment variables to store it securely.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Making Authenticated Requests

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rk_live_abc123xyz..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const API_KEY = process.env.ROULETTE_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ.get('ROULETTE_API_KEY')

response = requests.get(
    'https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid or expired API key",
  "data": null
}
```

Common causes of authentication errors:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Invalid API key | Key doesn't exist or was deleted | Generate a new API key |
| Expired API key | Key has passed its expiration date | Create a new key |
| Missing header | `Authorization` header not included | Add the header to your request |
| Malformed header | Header format is incorrect | Use `Bearer YOUR_KEY` format |

## API Key Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code. Use environment variables:

    ```bash
    # .env file (don't commit this!)
    ROULETTE_API_KEY=rk_live_abc123xyz...
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Access in your code
    const apiKey = process.env.ROULETTE_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Different Keys for Different Environments">
    Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production. This allows you to:
    - Rotate keys independently
    - Track usage per environment
    - Limit blast radius if a key is compromised
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially for production systems. You can have multiple active keys to allow for zero-downtime rotation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Key Usage">
    Regularly check your API key usage in the dashboard to detect any unusual activity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **1000 requests** per minute per API key
- **100 requests** per second per API key

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 60 seconds.",
  "data": null
}
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your application to gracefully handle rate limits.
</Tip>

## Permissions

Your API key inherits the permissions of your user account. This means:

- You can only access data for accounts/teams you're a member of
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies apply to all API requests
- Admin actions require admin-level account permissions

<Note>
  If you need access to data across multiple teams, make sure your user account has been invited to those teams.
</Note>
