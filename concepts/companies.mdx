# Companies

Companies are the core entity in Roulette, representing potential investment opportunities in your deal flow pipeline.

## Company Properties

Each company record contains the following key properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique identifier |
| `account_id` | UUID | The team/account this company belongs to |
| `name` | string | Company name |
| `website` | string | Company website URL |
| `description` | string | Brief description of the company |
| `deck_link` | string | URL to external pitch deck |
| `deck_storage_path` | string | Internal path to uploaded deck |
| `notes` | string | Internal notes (not visible to company) |
| `company_status_id` | UUID | Current pipeline stage |
| `visibility` | enum | Access control level |
| `source` | enum | How the company was added |
| `metadata` | object | Custom fields and data |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the record was created |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | When last modified |

## Visibility Levels

Companies can have different visibility settings to control who can access them:

  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Only visible to the user who created it
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared" icon="user-group">
    Visible to specific users you choose
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team" icon="users">
    Visible to all team members
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```javascript
// Create a private company
const company = await createCompany({
  name: "Stealth Startup",
  visibility: "private",
  // ...
});

// Share with specific users
await addCompanyShare(company.id, { user_id: "user-uuid" });
```

## Sources

Track how companies enter your pipeline:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `manual` | Manually added through the UI or API |
| `email` | Imported from an email |
| `form` | Submitted through an integrated form |
| `referral` | Referred by another contact |
| `website` | Applied through your website |
| `event` | Met at an event or conference |
| `other` | Other sources |

## Pitch Decks

Roulette supports two ways to attach pitch decks to companies:

### External Links
Link to decks hosted on DocSend, Google Drive, or other platforms:

```json
{
  "deck_link": "https://docsend.com/view/abc123"
}
```

### Direct Upload
Upload PDFs directly to Roulette for secure storage and AI analysis:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@pitch-deck.pdf" \
  -F "company_data={\"name\":\"Acme Corp\",\"account_id\":\"...\"}"
```

<Tip>
  Uploaded decks can be analyzed with AI to automatically extract company information, team details, and key metrics.
</Tip>

## Metadata

Use the `metadata` field to store custom data specific to your workflow:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "industry": "SaaS",
    "stage": "Series A",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "check_size": "$2M",
    "lead_partner": "Jane Smith",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Metadata is stored as JSONB in the database, so you can store any valid JSON structure.
