## Make your first request

Fetch companies from your deal pipeline:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data.companies);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
)

print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "companies": [
      {
        "id": "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7",
        "name": "Acme Corp",
        "deck_link": "https://docsend.com/view/example",
        "source": "email",
        "company_status": {
          "status_text": "Initial Review",
          "color": "#3B82F6"
        },
        "metadata": {
          "ai_analysis": "B2B SaaS for workflow automation",
          "founders": [
            { "name": "Jane Smith", "title": "CEO" }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "has_next": true,
      "has_prev": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Add a company with AI

The fastest way to add deals is the AI upload endpoint. Paste an email, a DocSend link, or any text - the AI extracts everything automatically:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -F "text=Hey, wanted to share our deck: https://docsend.com/view/abc123

We're building AI tools for sales teams. Currently at $50k MRR.

Best,
Jane Smith
CEO, TechStartup"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('account_id', 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID');
formData.append('text', `Hey, wanted to share our deck: https://docsend.com/view/abc123

We're building AI tools for sales teams. Currently at $50k MRR.

Best,
Jane Smith
CEO, TechStartup`);

const response = await fetch('https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
  body: formData
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
    data={
        'account_id': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID',
        'text': '''Hey, wanted to share our deck: https://docsend.com/view/abc123

We're building AI tools for sales teams. Currently at $50k MRR.

Best,
Jane Smith
CEO, TechStartup'''
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

The AI automatically:
- Extracts the DocSend URL and downloads the deck
- Detects this came from an email (sets `source: "email"`)
- Creates the company record with the extracted name

<Tip>
  Find your `account_id` in your dashboard URL: `useroulette.com/home/{account_id}/...`
</Tip>

## Analyze a pitch deck

Already have a company in your pipeline? Use AI to extract structured data from the deck:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/{company_id}/analyze" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This populates `metadata.founders`, `metadata.ai_analysis`, and your custom fields.

<Note>
  AI operations (upload/ai and analyze) consume credits from your account. You receive 500 credits/month with your subscription.
