| `name` | string | Company name |

| `deck_storage_path` | string | Internal path to uploaded deck |
| `notes` | string | Internal notes (not visible to company) |
| `company_status_id` | UUID | Current pipeline stage |
| `company_status` | object | Embedded status object with `status_text`, `color`, `rank` |
| `visibility` | enum | Access control level (`private`, `shared`, `team`) |
| `source` | enum | How the company was added |
| `source_content` | string | Raw source content (e.g., form submission data) |
| `metadata` | object | Custom fields, AI analysis, and founder data |
| `assignees` | array | Team members assigned to this company |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the record was created |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | When last modified |

## Visibility Levels

Companies can have different visibility settings to control who can access them:

  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Only visible to the user who created it
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared" icon="user-group">
    Visible to specific users you choose
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team" icon="users">
    Visible to all team members
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```javascript
// Create a private company
const company = await createCompany({
  name: "Stealth Startup",
  visibility: "private",
  // ...
});

// Share with specific users
await addCompanyShare(company.id, { user_id: "user-uuid" });
```

## Sources

Track how companies enter your pipeline:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `manual` | Manually added through the UI or API |
| `email` | Imported from an email |
| `form` | Submitted through an integrated form |
| `referral` | Referred by another contact |
| `website` | Applied through your website |
| `event` | Met at an event or conference |
| `other` | Other sources |

## Pitch Decks

Roulette supports two ways to attach pitch decks to companies:

### External Links
Link to decks hosted on DocSend, Google Drive, or other platforms:

```json
{
  "deck_link": "https://docsend.com/view/abc123"
}
```

### AI-Powered Upload
Use the intelligent upload endpoint to process emails, forms, or any text with deck URLs:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -F "text=Here's our deck: https://docsend.com/view/abc123" \
  -F "name=Acme Corp"
```

You can also upload files directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://useroulette.com/api/v1/companies/upload/ai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -F "text=Meeting notes from coffee chat" \
  -F "name=Acme Corp" \
  -F "file_0=@pitch-deck.pdf"
```

<Tip>
  The AI endpoint automatically extracts URLs from text, prioritizes deck platforms (DocSend, Papermark, etc.),
  and can analyze content to auto-detect the source and suggest a pipeline status.
</Tip>

## Metadata

The `metadata` field contains structured data including AI-extracted information and custom fields:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "founders": [
      {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "title": "CEO/Co-Founder",
        "email": "jane@example.com",
        "linkedin_profile": "https://linkedin.com/in/janesmith",
        "background": "Former engineer at Google"
      }
    ],
    "ai_analysis": "B2B SaaS platform for enterprise workflow automation...",
    "analyzed_at": "2024-01-15T12:45:00Z",
    "user_preferences": [
      {
        "type": "select",
        "field": "Industry",
        "value": "SaaS",
        "options": ["SaaS", "Fintech", "AI/ML", "Developer Tools"],
        "show_in_table": true
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "field": "Check Size",
        "value": "$2M",
        "show_in_table": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Metadata Structure
